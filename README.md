# go-yelp

Simple go client for the Yelp Fusion (v3) API.

## Examples
Basic examples can be found [here](/example/main.go#32), which can be used to test
the client / API locally. The file can be modified to test out other API request
parameters. The examples can be run with `make`:
```
make example api_key=my_api_key
```
